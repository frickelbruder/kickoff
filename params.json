  "body": "### Why Kickoff.\r\n\r\nAs a webdeveloper, it is not easy to always think about all the aspects of a webpage. There are issues like security, seo, performance and other individual requirements to your website, which are vital to a good seo ranking or a good user experience. Those tests could:\r\n * Provide an X-XSS-Protection header.\r\n * Deliver an HTML document in less than 1 second.\r\n * Your redirects should use a 301 header\r\n * Your cookie should be accessible via HttpOnly\r\n * Your title tag should only be 70 characters long\r\n * [...]\r\n\r\nTo make sure, these requirements are always met, you best test during your CD cycle, that nothing broke at your live site. \r\nA missing X-XSS-Protection header or a wrong HTTP-Response can be fatal for your users or your seo rankings.\r\nEntrance kickoff.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to install kickoff.\r\n\r\n#### Phar\r\n\r\nVisit the [Releases-Tab](https://github.com/frickelbruder/kickoff/releases) on github and download the latestest releases kickoff.phar file.\r\n\r\n#### Composer\r\n\r\n    composer require frickelbruder/kickoff\r\n\r\n### Example usage\r\n\r\nBe sure, to change the host settings in the following example file.\r\n\r\n#### Phar\r\n    \r\n    ./kickoff.phar run example/seo.yml\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Composer\r\n    \r\n    ./bin/KickOff.php run example/seo.yml\r\n\r\n### Integration to CD\r\n\r\nKickoff is able to write a jUnit compatible log file. Just add the appropriate parameter:\r\n    \r\n    ./bin/KickOff.php run -j build/logs/kickoff.xml example/seo.yml\r\n\r\nYou can now run kickoff in your CD process and let eg. jenkins read the results of the kickoff.xml. Just use the JUnit parser.\r\n",
